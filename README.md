# Lung-Cancer-Nodule-Detection

# Data Science bowl challenge to detect cancerous nodules in lungs using Convolution Neural Network

Process:
  - Used the existing Restnet50 and XGboost to train the model
  - Lung segmentation was performed using image morphology processing techniques
  - script.py is the main file for model loading and running
